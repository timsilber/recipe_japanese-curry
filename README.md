## Before getting started

### On curry roux

While you can definitely make a curry roux from scratch, it's hard to beat the quality and convenience of Japanese boxed curry roux. There are many different Japanese curry roux variants.

You should opt for the *Medium Hot* or *Hot* versions from a given manufacturer whenever possible. They're really not spicy, and have a more enjoyable flavor profile.

A good introductory roux is [Vermont Curry](https://www.amazon.com/House-Foods-Vermont-Curry-Medium/dp/B0722DCVY1/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2FFUGHOL9HWDW&keywords=vermont%2Bcurry&qid=1681077031&s=grocery&sprefix=vermont%2Bcurry%2Cgrocery%2C62&sr=1-2&th=1), which tends to be on the sweeter and fruity side. [Golden Curry](https://www.amazon.com/Golden-Curry-Sauce-Medium-8-4-Ounce/dp/B0011ULFVG/ref=sr_1_10?crid=12JOQ08N8S7N2&keywords=golden+curry&qid=1681077068&s=grocery&sprefix=golden+curry%2Cgrocery%2C66&sr=1-10) is more ginger- and cumin- forward, and in my experience, it's one of the easier brands to find. 

I usually create a 50:50 mixture from two different manufacturers to created a more balanced curry.

### On protein

You can make this with any type of tough protein (pork shoulder, chicken thigh, etc). 

My preference is beef, usually a chuck roast. I used to make it with English-cut, bone-in short rib, but now everyone thinks they're cool and I've been priced out of using it for a casual weeknight meal. But it's still the best.

### On stocks

A really good stock is the base of so many aspects of cooking. Traditional store-bought stock is usually dilute, over-salted, and misses the unctuousness that comes from rendering collagen out of bones. I strongly recommend against it.

For applications where a real chicken stock matters, like a soup, I'll buy a bunch of chicken feet (cheap and high in collagen) and simmer away. I usually collect chicken bones in a bag in my freezer, which I'll also throw in.

But in most sauces, braises, etc, you don't need to go through the pains of making a nice stock. Instead, I make them as needed using water, hondashi, and gelatin. 

Hondashi is a widely-used powdered approximation of dashi, which creates a ton of depth and subtle smokiness.

<hr>
ℹ️ Hondashi contains MSG. In fact, Hondashi's vendor, Ajinomoto, was the first commercial producer of MSG in 1909. 
<br>

Anti-MSG rhetoric has [xenophobic origins](https://apnews.com/article/us-news-ap-top-news-eddie-huang-az-state-wire-social-media-c54f4c29ac416fcd5b634d2451386d4e). MSG is [safe to eat and is naturally occurring in tomatoes, yeast, and cheese](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/questions-and-answers-monosodium-glutamate-msg#:~:text=However%2C%20MSG%20occurs%20naturally%20in,as%20in%20tomatoes%20and%20cheeses).
<hr>

[Gelatin has many uses in the home kitchen](https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-use-gelatin-better-stock-sauce-dessert), one of which is simulating the effects of slowly rendering collagen from bones during a long stock simmer. 

I always keep both of these in my pantry – they have a ton of applications and are easy to store. But should you insist on using store-bought chicken stock, you could still add some gelatin to improve the mouthfeel.

## Recipe

### 1. Sear and braise

This following instructions cover the basics of a French braise, with some plus-ups I've incorporated over time. You could use this basic process for stews, chilis, or any other dish with a braised-meat base.

#### Ingredients

<input type="checkbox" id="1"><label for="1"> meat, big ol' chunk x 4 lb </label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="6"><label for="6"> water x 1.5 qt 
[hondashi](https://www.amazon.com/Ajinomoto-HONDASHI-Bonito-Stock-4-23oz/dp/B088HGKBNM/ref=sr_1_3?crid=21559UAA72GQI&keywords=hondashi&qid=1681077161&s=grocery&sprefix=hondashi%2Cgrocery%2C100&sr=1-3&th=1) x 2 tbsp </label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="7"><label for="7"> 
[gelatin](https://www.amazon.com/Knox-Gelatine-Unflavored-Count-Ounce/dp/B00BCMU7T4/ref=sr_1_21_f3_0g_fs?crid=TV0Y6HDLJDP0&keywords=gelatin%2Bknox%2Bpack&qid=1681077247&s=grocery&sprefix=gelatin%2Bknox%2Bpack%2Cgrocery%2C74&sr=1-21&th=1) x 2 tbsp </label><br>

To prepare your braise:

1. Heat a heavy-bottomed pot (like a dutch oven) on high heat. It should be the temp you would sear a steak.
   
2. Add some neutral oil to lightly cover the bottom, then put meat in until the bottom is covered. I usually do this in two batches — don’t overcrowd, otherwise you’re going to be steaming instead of searing. 

![start sear](/assets/start-sear.png)
   
3. Sprinkle salt over the top, then let the meat sear for a few minutes. 

<hr> 
ℹ️ Optionally, if you have a cooking weight like a <a href="https://www.thechefspress.com/shop">Chef's Press</a> (or really anything heavy, I’ve used cans of beans or a brick with a layer of foil underneath), you’ll get a better sear. 
<br><br>

![chefs press](assets/chefs-press.png)

<hr>

4. Flip meat, then repeat step 3 until the second side is seared. Depending on how thick the meat is, you can also repeat step 3 for the other two sides. 
   
![flip sear](assets/sear-flip.png)
   
5. Remove from heat, then transfer meat to a cutting board. Repeat steps 3-6 with remaining meat. 
   
![all seared](assets/all-seared.png)

<hr> 
ℹ️ When you're done searing, you'll probably have a bunch of fond stuck to your pot. Don't clean it off, you'll be rehydrating all that good stuff in step 9.
<br><br>

![fond](assets/fond.png)

<hr> 

6. Let meat rest for 5-10 min, then debone (if applicable) and cut meat into large chunks. The meat should still be raw inside. 

![seared chunks](assets/seared-chunks.png)

<hr> 
ℹ️ I generally like to braise on the larger side using ~2" pieces, but I was hungry and wanted the braise to go faster on this round, so I cut into smaller chunks this time.
<hr> 

7. Preheat oven to 300ºF. 
8. Add 2 cups of water, hondashi, and gelatin to the searing vessel, then return to high heat. 

<hr> 
ℹ️ If using your own stock, you can just add that here instead of the hondashi and gelatin.
<hr> 

9. As the water heats, start whisking to deglaze the fond and to incorporate the gelatin and hondashi.

![whisk fond](assets/whisk-fond.png)

10.  When dashi and gelatin are dissolved, add your meat chunks (and bones, if applicable) to the pot.

![meat in pot](assets/meat-in-pot.png)

11. Add remaining 1 quart of water (or enough to just cover meat), then bring to a boil. 

<hr> 
ℹ️ As the water boils, scum (primarily composed of coagulated myoglobin and bone dust) will float to the top. I generally skim this off with a fine mesh skimmer to produce a cleaner-tasting product, but it's not particularly necessary.
<br><br>

![skim boil](assets/boil-skim.png)
<hr> 

12.  As soon as the water boils, remove from heat and transfer pot to oven. 

<hr> 
ℹ️ The goal is to maintain a consistent bare simmer throughout the braise. You can partially cover the pot with a lid to help maintain the temperature if necessary, but do not cover completely with lid.
<br><br>

<hr> 

13.  Braise meat until mostly tender. This will depend on your choice of protein, the size of your chunks, your oven, etc. For me, this generally takes 1.5 hours. I start checking after 1 hour, and would never go past 3 hours. No one wants meat mush.

![braised meat](assets/braised-meat.png)

### 2. Mise en place

Prep your vegetables while your meat simmers away in the oven. 

#### Ingredients
<input type="checkbox" id="2"><label for="2"> onions, large yellow x 3 </label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="3"><label for="3"> mushrooms, baby bella x 1 lb </label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="4"><label for="4"> carrots x 4-6 </label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="5"><label for="5"> russet potatoes x 2-3 </label><br>

I have a pretty liberal definition of bite-sized, but here's how I like my vegetables:

| Vegetable | Prep |
| - | - |
| Onion | Large chunks, ~1.5 inch squares |
| Potato | Very large chunks, ~2 inch squares. For reference, I cut large Russet potatoes into eighths. |
| Carrot | Large chunks. I use large [rangiri](https://www.kikkoman.com/en/cookbook/jstyle/japanesecutting.html#:~:text=Rangiri%20is%20a%20way%20of,method%20particularly%20suitable%20when%20simmering.) cuts and the pieces are approximately two inches long |
| Mushroom | I cut baby bellas in half, and larger ones in quarters. Mushrooms tend to expel a lot of moisture and shrink as they sauté. |

![mise en place](assets/mise-en-place.png)

<hr> 
ℹ️ Keeping potatoes in water prevents them from oxidizing. Remember to drain before using. 
<hr> 

### 3. Cook vegetables

You'll begin this step by sautéing off the onions and mushrooms while the meat is braising. I like to start this process about 20 minutes before the meat is ready.

<hr> 
ℹ️ You should use a pot that will be able to comfortably fit all your vegetables and meat. For reference, here's the the (4-quart) pot I used to braise the meat next to the (8-quart) pot I use for this step.
<br><br>

![pot size](assets/pot-size.png)

When factoring in the size of your pot, you can cut the volume of onions and mushrooms in half to account for moisture loss.
<hr> 

#### Ingredients

<input type="checkbox" id="13"><label for="13"> 
almost-braised pot of meat<a href="#1-sear-and-braise">from step 1</a></label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="14"> mise en place<a href="#2-mise-en-place"> from step 2</a></label><br><label for="14"> 

To cook vegetables:

1. Add mushrooms, onions, and 1/4 cup of water to your pot, then cover and heat on medium-high.

<hr> 
Adding a bit of water to this process makes the initial stage of sauté more efficient overall, and allows you to use less oil in the frying step.
<hr> 

2. Cook mushrooms and onions until they have reduced in volume and onions are beginning to turn translucent, ~10 minutes. You should stir intermittently during this step to ensure even heat distribution and prevent burning.

![start saute](assets/post-saute-onions-and-mushrooms.png)

3. Add some oil, then sauté until onions are translucent and lightly starting to brown, ~5 minutes.
   
4. Add potatoes, then briefly mix everything together.

![potato](assets/add-potatoes.png)
   
<hr> 
If your braise needs more time, remove the vegetable pot from heat until braise is complete. 
<hr> 

5. Transfer meat and braising liquid to the pot. I usually use a slotted spoon to move the meat into the vegetable pot, then pour the braising liquid in directly.

![add meat](assets/add-braise-meat-and-liquid.png)

<hr> 
Your braising liquid should be sufficient to mostly submerge everything. You can add a splash or two of water as needed, but I'd refrain if possible -- it dilutes the flavor and thickness of the curry.
<hr> 

6. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer. 
7. After 5 minutes, add carrots, then continue to simmer until vegetables are cooked, ~7-10 more minutes. 

![add carrots](assets/add-carrots.png)

<hr>
Potatoes and carrots are generally done when the tip of a paring knife can be inserted into the center of the vegetable with little resistance, but I usually just take a bit out of one when I think it's ready. 
<hr>

8. Turn off heat

## 4. Finishing

#### Ingredients

<input type="checkbox" id="8"><label for="8"> curry roux x 1 box </label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="8"><label for="8"> apple, fuji x 1 </label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="9"><label for="9"> (optional) [tonkatsu sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Bull-Dog-Bull-Dog-Tonkatsu-Sauce/dp/B0002IZD1G?th=1) (or ketchup with a few dashes of worcestershire sauce), to taste </label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="10"><label for="10"> (optional) honey, to taste </label><br>
<input type="checkbox" id="11"><label for="11">(optional) heavy cream, to taste </label><br>

To finish the dish, finely chop the curry roux before adding to the pot. 

![chop roux](assets/chopped-curry-roux.png)

At this point, your vegetables and meat are delicate, and too much agitation with turn them to mush.

I usually incorporate the curry by adding it to a ladle, dipping in some broth, then using a pair of chopsticks to turn the roux into a paste before incorporating into the larger pot. 

![roux in ladle](assets/curry-in-ladle.png)
![roux to paste](assets/roux-to-paste.png)

But, this stuff is meant to dissolve pretty easily, so I wouldn't worry too much if you just want to toss it in.

At this point, you're done! I usually grate in a fuji apple, then adjust taste with some sauces I have laying around depending on what it needs. These include some combination of:

* A few dashes of soy sauce
* A squeeze of tonkatsu sauce (I use Bulldog brand, but ketchup works too)
* A tablespoon of honey 

![final curry](assets/curry-final.png)

## 5. Serving

![to serve](assets/curry-in-bowls.png)

Serve with warm rice. I really like jasmine rice, but short grain is probably more traditional. I also cook my rice on the drier side for use with curry.

I think it's pretty standard to add rice to one half of the bowl and pour a nice ladle of curry into the other half, but I like to eat with two bowls to control the mixing. 

It's also common to serve with some kind of pickled vegetable (fukujinzuke {TODO: need resource}) for brightness and to refresh the palette, but you'll still very much enjoy your curry without it. 


## Storing and reheating 

The curry lasts for a week in the fridge, and will usually improve in taste over the first couple of days. 

Your curry will usually lose thickness as it ages. To account for this, I like to reheat in a pot over low heat on the stove, which helps adjust the thickness of the curry to your liking. Stir intermittently and optionally add a splash of water to prevent scorching.

The microwave will also work fine, but I'd skip the splash of water.
