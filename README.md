ℹ️ You can make this with any type of tough protein (pork shoulder, chicken thigh, etc). 

<br>My preference is beef, usually a chuck roast. I used to make it with English cut bone-in short rib, but now everyone thinks they're cool and I've been priced out of using it for a casual weeknight meal. But it's still the best.

big ol' chunk of meat x 4 lb
large onions x 4
baby bella mushrooms x 1 lb 
carrots x 4-6


1.5 qt water
2 tbsp gelatin
2 tbsp hondashi 

## Before getting started

A really good stock is the base of so many aspects of cooking. Traditional store-bought stock is usually dilute, over-salted, and misses the unctuousness that comes from rendering collagen out of bones. I strongly recommend against it.

For applications where a real stock matters, like a soup, I'll buy a bunch of chicken feet (cheap and high in collagen) and simmer away. I usually collect chicken bones in a bag in my freezer, which I'll also throw in.

But in most sauces, braises, etc, you don't need to go through the pains of making a nice stock. I make my own stocks on the fly using water, hondashi (), and gelatin. 

Hondashi creates a ton of depth and subtle smokiness, while gelatin simulates the effects of slowly rendering collagen from bones during a long stock simmer. 

You should keep both of these in your pantry – they have a ton of applications, and are easy to store. But should you insist on using store-bought chicken stock, you could add some gelatin to improve the mouthfeel.

## Sear and braise

big ol' chunk of meat x 4 lb
neutral oil (grapeseed or avocado oil is my preference)


1. Heat a heavy-bottomed pot (like a dutch oven) on high heat. It should be the temp you would sear a steak.

2. Add some neutral oil to lightly cover the bottom, then put meat in until the bottom is covered. I usually do this in two batches — don’t overcrowd, otherwise you’re going to be steaming instead of searing. 
   
3. Sprinkle salt over the top, then let the meat sear for a few minutes. 

<hr> 
Optionally, if you have a cooking weight like a Chefs Press (or really anything heavy, I’ve used cans of beans or a brick with a layer of foil underneath), you’ll get a better sear.

5. Flip meat, then repeat step 3 until the second side is seared. Depending on how thick the meat is, you can also repeat step 3 for the other two sides.

6. Remove from heat, then transfer meat to a cutting board. Repeat steps 3-6 with remaining meat.

When you're done searing, you'll probably have a bunch of fond stuck to your pot. Don't clean it off, you'll be rehydrating all that good stuff in step 9.

7. Let meat rest for 5-10 min, then debone (if applicable) and cut meat into large chunks. The meat should still be raw inside.

<hr> 
I generally like to braise on the larger side using ~2" pieces, but I was hungry and wanted the braise to go faster on this round, so I cut into smaller chunks.

8. Preheat oven to 300ºF. 
9. Add 2 cups of water, hondashi, and gelatin to the searing vessel, then return to high heat. 

<hr> 
If using your own stock, you could just add that here instead.

9. As the water heats, start whisking up all the fond and incorporating the gelatin and hondashi into the mixture.

10.  When dashi and gelatin are dissolved, add your meat chunks (and bones, if applicable) to the pot.

11. Add remaining 1 quart of water (or enough to cover meat), then bring to a boil. 

<hr> 
As the water boils, scum (primarily composed of coagulated myoglobin and bone dust) will float to the top. I generally skim this off with a fine mesh skimmer to produce a cleaner-tasting product, but it's not particularly necessary.

12.  As soon as the water boils, remove from heat and transfer pot to oven. 

<hr> 
I usually partially cover the pot with the lid during this step, but the overall goal is to maintain a bare simmer throughout the braise.

1.    Braise meat until mostly tender. This will depend on your choice of protein, the size of your chunks, your oven, etc. For me, this generally takes 1.5 hours. I start checking after 1 hour, and would never go past 3 hours. No one wants meat mush.
