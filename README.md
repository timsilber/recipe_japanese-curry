## Before getting started

## On protein

You can make this with any type of tough protein (pork shoulder, chicken thigh, etc). 

My preference is beef, usually a chuck roast. I used to make it with English cut bone-in short rib, but now everyone thinks they're cool and I've been priced out of using it for a casual weeknight meal. But it's still the best.

### On stocks

A really good stock is the base of so many aspects of cooking. Traditional store-bought stock is usually dilute, over-salted, and misses the unctuousness that comes from rendering collagen out of bones. I strongly recommend against it.

For applications where a real stock matters, like a soup, I'll buy a bunch of chicken feet (cheap and high in collagen) and simmer away. I usually collect chicken bones in a bag in my freezer, which I'll also throw in.

But in most sauces, braises, etc, you don't need to go through the pains of making a nice stock. I make my own stocks on the fly using water, hondashi (), and gelatin. 

Hondashi creates a ton of depth and subtle smokiness, while gelatin simulates the effects of slowly rendering collagen from bones during a long stock simmer. 

You should keep both of these in your pantry – they have a ton of applications, and are easy to store. But should you insist on using store-bought chicken stock, you could add some gelatin to improve the mouthfeel.

## Sear and braise

big ol' chunk of meat x 4 lb
neutral oil (grapeseed or avocado oil is my preference)


1. Heat a heavy-bottomed pot (like a dutch oven) on high heat. It should be the temp you would sear a steak.

2. Add some neutral oil to lightly cover the bottom, then put meat in until the bottom is covered. I usually do this in two batches — don’t overcrowd, otherwise you’re going to be steaming instead of searing. 
   
3. Sprinkle salt over the top, then let the meat sear for a few minutes. 

<hr> 
Optionally, if you have a cooking weight like a Chefs Press (or really anything heavy, I’ve used cans of beans or a brick with a layer of foil underneath), you’ll get a better sear. 
<br><br>

![chefs press](assets/chefs-press.png)

<hr>

5. Flip meat, then repeat step 3 until the second side is seared. Depending on how thick the meat is, you can also repeat step 3 for the other two sides. 
   
![flip sear](assets/sear-flip.png)
   
6. Remove from heat, then transfer meat to a cutting board. Repeat steps 3-6 with remaining meat. 
   
![all seared](assets/all-seared.png)

<hr> 
When you're done searing, you'll probably have a bunch of fond stuck to your pot. Don't clean it off, you'll be rehydrating all that good stuff in step 9.
<br><br>

![fond](assets/fond.png)

<hr> 

7. Let meat rest for 5-10 min, then debone (if applicable) and cut meat into large chunks. The meat should still be raw inside. 

![seared chunks](assets/seared-chunks.png)

   
<hr> 
I generally like to braise on the larger side using ~2" pieces, but I was hungry and wanted the braise to go faster on this round, so I cut into smaller chunks.
<hr> 

8. Preheat oven to 300ºF. 
9. Add 2 cups of water, hondashi, and gelatin to the searing vessel, then return to high heat. 

<hr> 
If using your own stock, you could just add that here instead.
<hr> 

9. As the water heats, start whisking up all the fond and incorporating the gelatin and hondashi into the mixture.

![whisk fond](assets/whisk-fond.png)

10.  When dashi and gelatin are dissolved, add your meat chunks (and bones, if applicable) to the pot.

![meat in pot](assets/meat-in-pot.png)

11. Add remaining 1 quart of water (or enough to cover meat), then bring to a boil. 

<hr> 
As the water boils, scum (primarily composed of coagulated myoglobin and bone dust) will float to the top. I generally skim this off with a fine mesh skimmer to produce a cleaner-tasting product, but it's not particularly necessary.
<br><br>

![skim boil](assets/boil-skim.png)
<hr> 

12.  As soon as the water boils, remove from heat and transfer pot to oven. 

<hr> 
I usually partially cover the pot with the lid during this step, but the overall goal is to maintain a bare simmer throughout the braise.

<hr> 

13.   Braise meat until mostly tender. This will depend on your choice of protein, the size of your chunks, your oven, etc. For me, this generally takes 1.5 hours. I start checking after 1 hour, and would never go past 3 hours. No one wants meat mush.

## Mise en place

Prep your vegetables while your meat simmers away in the oven. I have a pretty liberal definition of bite-sized, but here's how I like my vegetables:

| Vegetable | Prep |
| - | - |
| Onion | Large chunks, ~1.5 inch squares |
| Potato | Very large chunks, ~2 inch squares. For reference, I cut large Russet potatoes into eighths. |
| Carrot | Large chunks. I use large [rangiri](https://www.kikkoman.com/en/cookbook/jstyle/japanesecutting.html#:~:text=Rangiri%20is%20a%20way%20of,method%20particularly%20suitable%20when%20simmering.) cuts and the pieces are approximately two inches long |
| Mushroom | I cut baby bellas in half, and larger ones in quarters. Mushrooms tend to expel a lot of moisture and shrink as they sauté. |

![mise en place](assets/mise-en-place.png)

<hr> 
Keeping potatoes in water prevents them from oxidizing. Remember to drain before using. 
<hr> 

## Cook aromatics

In this step, you'll sauté off the onions and mushrooms while the meat is braising. I like to start this process about 20 minutes before the meat is ready.

<hr> 
You should use a pot that will be able to comfortably fit all your vegetables and meat. Here's the large pot I use, relative to the one I braise the meat in.
<br><br>

![pot size](assets/pot-size.png)

When factoring in the size of your pot, you can cut the volume of onions and mushrooms in half to account for moisture loss.
<hr> 

To prepare:

1. Add mushrooms, onions, and 1/4 cup of water to your pot, then cover and heat on medium-high.

<hr> 
Adding a bit of water to this process makes the initial stage of sauté more efficient overall, and allows you to use less oil in the frying step.
<hr> 

2. Cook mushrooms and onions until they have reduced in volume and onions are beginning to turn translucent, ~10 minutes. You should stir intermittently during this step to ensure even heat distribution and prevent burning.

![start saute](assets/post-saute-onions-and-mushrooms.png)

3. Add some oil, then sauté until onions are translucent and lightly starting to brown, ~5 minutes.
   
4. Add potatoes, then briefly mix everything together.

![potato](assets/add-potatoes.png)
   
<hr> 
If your braise needs more time, remove the vegetable pot from heat until braise is complete. 
<hr> 

5. Transfer meat and braising liquid to the pot. I usually use a slotted spoon to move the meat into the vegetable pot, then pour the braising liquid in directly.

![add meat](assets/add-braise-meat-and-liquid.png)

<hr> 
Your braising liquid should be sufficient to mostly submerge everything. You can add a splash or two of water as needed, but I'd refrain if possible -- it dilutes the flavor and thickness of the curry.
<hr> 

6. Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer. 
7. After 5 minutes, add carrots, then continue to simmer until vegetables are cooked, ~7-10 more minutes. 

![add carrots](assets/add-carrots.png)

<hr>
Potatoes and carrots are generally done when the tip of a paring knife can be inserted into the center of the vegetable with little resistance, but I usually just take a bit out of one when I think it's ready. 
<hr>

8. Turn off heat

## Finishing

To finish the dish, finely chop the curry roux before adding to the pot. 

![chop roux](assets/chopped-curry-roux.png)

At this point, your vegetables and meat are delicate, and too much agitation with turn them to mush.

I usually incorporate the curry by adding it to a ladle, dipping in some broth, then using a pair of chopsticks to turn the roux into a paste before incorporating into the larger pot. 

![roux in ladle](assets/curry-in-ladle.png)
![roux to paste](assets/roux-to-paste.png)

But, this stuff is meant to dissolve pretty easily, so I wouldn't worry too much if you just want to toss it in.

At this point, you're done! I usually grate in a fuji apple, then adjust taste with some sauces I have laying around depending on what it needs. These include some combination of:

* A few dashes of soy sauce
* A squeeze of tonkatsu sauce (I use Bulldog brand, but ketchup works too)
* A tablespoon of honey

## Serving

![to serve](assets/curry-in-bowls.png)

Serve with warm rice. I really like jasmine rice, but short grain is probably more traditional. I also cook my rice on the drier side for use with curry.

I think it's pretty standard to add rice to one half of the bowl and pour a nice ladle of curry into the other half, but I like to eat with two bowls to control the mixing. 

It's also common to serve with some kind of pickled vegetable (fukujinzuke) for brightness and to refresh the palette, but you'll still very much enjoy your curry without it. 


## Storing and reheating 

The curry lasts for a week in the fridge, and will usually improve in taste over the first couple of days. 

Your curry will usually lose thickness as it ages. To account for this, I like to reheat in a pot over low heat on the stove, which helps adjust the thickness of the curry to your liking. Stir intermittently and optionally add a splash of water to prevent scorching.

The microwave will also work fine, but I'd skip the splash of water.
